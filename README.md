- 👋 Hi, I’m Travis Rose, a Data Science and Analytics professional with a Master's in Business Analytics.
- 🌱 I’m currently working on data projects that benefit from the use of statistical and predictive modeling, visualization tools and ad-hoc analysis.
- 📖 I have used the Python language for the following statistical modeling techniques:
- 1. Using logistic regression modeling in Python, deployed a recommendation engine which rated insurance members on the likelihood of them completing a health risk          assessment when first being brought onto our insurance. Through this, we managed to increase completion rates by 7% per month compared to prior months.
  2. Using linear regression in Python, determined the statistical relationship between the member compliance rates for Medicaid-specific measures, and the initiatives       and incentives our LOBs have been putting forward. This has helped senior leadership adjust their programs and saved roughly 6% of their budget towards other 
     programs.
  3. Deployed a recommendation engine that rated credit union members based on the probability of them defaulting on their loans. This helped our lending team make 
     better lending decisions, leading to a roughly 3% drop in membership defaults compared to prior months.
- 🗺️ I have used Tableau, PowerBI, Python, and Excel for the following types of visualizations:
- 1. Creating visualizations to showcase trend analyses, or measures over time, to end users.
  2. Created dashboards for Key Performance Indicators (KPI) such as response rates to marketing campaigns, number of members with certain diseases, and more.
  3. Created mapping visuals showing the highest concentrations of my company's members in Ohio. Additionally, these visuals allow my end users to filter for 
     demographic information such as age, gender, and more, in order to see which demographics we may need to invest more time to outreach.
- 🕵️ Using my best detective hat, I often use SQL to perform dataset cleaning or ad-hoc (or a one-time) analysis, such as:
- 1. Creating summary statistics showcasing which service providers in our network have had a higher concentration of patients coming in versus those with lower              concentration.
  2. Creating complex CTEs and subqueries joining multiple tables and filtering them in place. This was in order to produce a dataset showcasing member characteristics,      claim counts, and their provider information. 
  3. Taking reports that would take days to be made within Excel, and generating them in mere minutes using a combination of both SQL and Python.
